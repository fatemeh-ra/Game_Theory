# Game_Theory

this repo contains implementation of some game theory algorithms.
the input representation is specified in each part and some test cases were writen to check the algorithm correctness.

## Extensive2Normal
in this part program computes the normal form game from the given extensive form.  the payoff matrix of each user will be computed for a 2-player game  and in n-player game according to each player strategy the payoff vectors of users will be calculated. 
it also derives all the subgame-perfect nash equiliria from the extensive form game.

## ConvexHull
this program depicts the convex hull for a given general-sum 2-player game.

## PureParetoOptimal
in this part program gets a general-sum n-player game and returns all payoff vectors obtained by pure strategies which are Pareto-optimal.

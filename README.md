# Game_Theory

This repo contains implementation of some game theory algorithms.

The input representation is specified in each part and some test cases were writen to check the algorithm correctness.

## Extensive2Normal
In this part program computes the normal form game from the given extensive form. The payoff matrix of each user will be computed for a 2-player game and in n-player game according to each player strategy the payoff vectors of users will be calculated. 

It also derives all subgame-perfect nash equiliria from the extensive form game.

## ConvexHull
This program depicts the convex hull of all feasible payoff vectors for a given general-sum 2-player game.

## PureParetoOptimal
In this part program gets a general-sum n-player game and returns all payoff vectors obtained by pure strategies which are Pareto-optimal.
